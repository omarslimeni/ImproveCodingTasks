LIN Local interconected Network
low speed bus up to 20 kbps
single master multi slaves
no arbitration required for LIN
guaranted message latency time

can be used in side mirrors doors switches window lift seat switches sunroof control ...
low cost implimentation based on UART interface , single wire , no hardware LIN controller required ,no crystal required for slaves
LIN has only one node that can start message transmission , no arbitraion
LIN protocol is handled by software drivers , cAN is handled by harware controllers
LIN has Schedule table which control bus utilization

device we need for LIN : example Vehicle Spy

LIN frame:
one message has two sources
master slaves protocol
master control alll communcations

we have master header + slave data

unconditional frame:
unconditional frames carry signals and their iditifier are from 0 to 0x3B
the header of unconditional frame is always transmitted when a frame slot allocated to the unconditional frame is processed
the publisher of the unconditional frame of the slave shall always provide the response to the header
header slave one responf , header slave two can respond also header from master and the master can be a slave so it can respond
Event Triggered frame:
the purpose of an event trigged frame is to increase the responsitivity of the LIN cluster 
all subscribers of the event triggered frame shall receive the frame and use its data as if the associeted unconditional frame was received
if we get two response from slave 1 and 2 we will have collosion and master need to reset the schedule table

sporadic frames
sporadic frame is a group of unconditional frames that share the same frame slot.

LIN master header : LIN break + Sync Byte + ID filed Byte

for the id : 0x0 to 0x3B for normal frames and 0x3C and 0x3D for diagnostic purposes

LIN break indicates a new frame is starting 
13 bits low and 1 bit high

sync used to allow salve detect baud rate
hew value 0x55
least significant bit firt

in the id  = protected identifier that contains identifier and parity 2 bit (64 different ids)
the slave could fill in 0-8 data byte and the last byte is always a checksum

LIN organizes LIN transmission with schedule table 
ther are predefined lists of IDs with assiciated transmission times
unlike CAN the master concept makes the bus time deterministic
